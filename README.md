# React Build Workflow

### Setup

1. Sudo npm install -g create-react-app
  -- install react globally on your machine `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/...index.js`
2. create-react-app react-app-name
  -- this will install `react`, `react-dom`, and `react-scripts`
3. Navigate into the project folder
4. Run `npm start`
  -- this will spin up the Development server
  -- keep the process running while you are working
  -- to close the server use `control + C`

### What does the project contain

1. node_modules
  -- holds all the dependencies and sub-dependencies for our project
  -- generate automatically when you ran `npm install` in project folder
2. public
  -- root folder that gets generated by the web server
  -- holds file only for editing
  -- holds `index.html` the only html page you need for a SPA
    -- this is where the script files will be inserted once code is written in the src folder
    -- there is a `<div id="root"></div>` which is used for mounting your react application
    -- you can use this html for importing other libraries (CSS,JS, etc)
  -- `manifest.json`file is used to define metadata for our application
3. src
  -- This is where the react application lives
  --`index.js` gets access to the `root` element in our dom (the div we saw in the index.html)
    -- `ReactDOM.render(<App />)` this is where the react application gets rendered; The `App` is an import `import App from ./App`;
  --`App.js` is where we see our first react component written in `JSX`
    -- THIS IS WHERE WE BEGIN CODING!!
  --`ServiceWorker.js` used for registering a service worker (generated automatically); it will pre-cache our script files
  --`App.test.js` allows for the creation of unit tests
4. package-lock.json <!-- can be ignored -->
5. package.json - contains all the general dependencies in the project
  -- dependencies: `name_of_dependency: "version"`
  -- react-scripts offers build workflow, Development server, next-gen js feature support
  -- scripts are also defined here which can be run with `npm run script_name`
  -- `npm start` is the only exception; start the Development server, watch, compile and optimize our code
  -- `npm run build` used for when deploying your code; to store your optimized code in a package

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
